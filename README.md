# Message Spammer
This code is a simple script that repeatedly writes the message "Message" using the keyboard module. The message can be changed by replacing the string within the keyboard.write() function. The code also includes a time.sleep() function, which causes the script to pause for 0.5 seconds before writing the message again. This process will repeat indefinitely as the script is contained within a while loop that is set to True.
